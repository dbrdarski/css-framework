- Created a browser-supported svg() function for inserting svgs directly in CSS. This enables to easily change a color on the spot or add extra space. (Example: see selects).
- Created smart vendor-prefixing mixin (and function).
- Changed %text-input to %input-text (may differ from existing projects).
